# M3CV
Medical Multi-Modal Computer Vision: a framework to support deep learning research

# Under construction!

If you are reading this I assume you are on my dissertation committee and I am glad that you're excited to see the code - I'm working on refactoring the capabilities into this repo right now. All of the described features in the written dissertation have been prototyped, they're just getting an extra coat of polish at the moment. Pieces will be added over the next few days as I finish these refactors.
